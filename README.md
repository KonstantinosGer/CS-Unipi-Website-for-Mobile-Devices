# CS-Unipi-Website-for-Mobile-Divices  
In this project we created a mobile-friendly website for the department of Informatics of the University of Piraeus based on its current website (www.cs.unipi.gr). Users can navigate on the site through a mobile device, access the departments' news which are loaded within a postgreSQL database and virtually perform every task that the main site can offer.  
This work uses PHP to load every .php page from the Apatche Server as long as JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the front-end part.
